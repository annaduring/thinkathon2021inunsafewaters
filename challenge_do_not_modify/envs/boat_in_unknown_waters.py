    **SUMMARY:**
    
    The goal of this task is to navigate a boat in unknown waters 
    so that it does not fall off a cliff for as long as possible,
    using its motor and rudder.
    
    The waters have weird, unknown currents 
    that stay constant during each episode but change from episode to episode.

    The boat's motion is thus a combination between being dragged by these currents 
    and being pushed and/or rotated by its motor.
    
    You can access all of the parameters mentioned below via the method 
    get_parameters(), but you cannot change them.
    
    
    **STATE:**
    
    (x, y, phi) where 
        x, y are the coordinates of the boat's position:
            y>=0: the boat has not fallen off the cliff
            y<0: the boat has fallen off the cliff
        phi is the angle of the ship's orientation:
            phi=0: boat points towards positive y ("up" in the visualisation)
            phi=pi/2: towards positive x ("right")
            phi=pi: towards negative y ("down")
            phi=1.5pi: towards negative x ("left")


    **ACTION:**

    (m, rho) where
        m is the motor speed between 0 and m_max 
        rho is the rudder angle between -rho_max and +rho_max:
            rho=0: motor drives boat forward in the direction of its orientation (phi)
            rho=-pi/2: motor turns boat left around its center of gravity without pushing it forward
            rho=pi/2: motor turns boat right around its center of gravity without pushing it forward
            rho between -pi/2 and 0: boat somewhat turns left and somewhat pushes forward 
            rho between 0 and pi/2: boat somewhat turns right and somewhat pushes forward 

    
    **TIME STEP:**

    While the actual motion of the boat happens in continuous time, 
    the agent can only change her action n_steps many times between time 0 and t_max,
    resulting in a step size of t_max/n_steps.
    This parameter n_steps can be chosen by you when you initialize the environment.
    A smaller n_steps speeds up the simulation, a larger n_steps gives the agent more control.
    The default value of n_steps is 1000.

    
    **OBSERVATION:**

    (x, y, phi, dx/dt, dy/dt, dphi/dt) where
        (x, y, phi) is the current state (see above) and
        (dx/dt, dy/dt, dphi/dt) is its current time derivative given the last action 

    
    **TERMINATION:**

    An episode terminates as soon as y gets negative (the boat falls off the cliff)
    or the target time t_max is reached.


    **REWARD:**
    
    Before time t_max, the reward is always zero. 
    If the boat does not fall off the cliff (y<0) before time t_max, 
    it gets a final reward of 1.0 at time t_max.
    In other words, the goal is to maximize the probability of "surviving" until time t_max.

    This is the reward function used in the official evaluation 
    of the trained agent at the end of the thinkathon.
    
    During the training phase, you may want to use auxiliary reward functions
    that help the learner evaluate her actions. 
    Such an auxiliary reward functions could e.g. be the survival time 
    (i.e., assume a reward of 1 in each step).
    Another auxiliary reward function could be based on the distance to the cliff
    and give a reward of y in each step.
